            "In my opinion the crypto markets are primarily influenced by interest rates. The bitcoin halving coincidently has happened at the same time as low rates. 2018 and 2022 are years when the fed has increased rates and we see CryptoCurrency dropping heavily.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now why have rates been increasing? Because of inflation, inflation in my opinion is primarily the result of the covid shutdown and the war, i.e not enough supply. (Not because of money printing). \n",
            "\n",
            "Inflation is judged on a year on year basis, with oil and gas having spiked severely in 2022 but are now falling back to more normal levels. Come April 2023 year on year inflation will be a lot lower because prices have dropped since April 2022. The opening of the chinese economy will also reduce inflation of chinese goods. \n",

            "With low inflation the fed pivots dramatically, resulting in huge gains. Most of us here will be millionaires come 2024.\n",

            "\n",
            "I honestly think with where we are currently and the likelihood of a crab / very minor climb through 2023, the best thing we can all do is put what money we can, on a regular basis, into BTC/ETH and a few alts we believe in.\n",
            "\n",
            "If we can accept the low we're at now (could go a bit lower but I think we're near-bottom) and ride the steady bus journey along month by month, we will all build our bags and likely average down (depending where you came in) and be in such a great position when the bull arrives.\n",

The S&P 500 is around the February 2020 high adjusted for inflation. Crab or drop a bit more to the end of February and we'll have an inflation adjusted 3 year flat period. Rates are approaching 5% and unemployment has remained under 4%. Large lay-offs make headlines but labor markets making new hires don't. I'm positive 2023 will be a flat to minor red year at least for traditional markets. Minor green would be cool. Labor markets, I'm betting unemployment remains under 4.5% which is still low unemployment. To me this sets up 2023 to be a year to continue to improve corporate balance sheets, DCA into crypto and speculative growth companies\n",
            "Long slow year ahead. Load up your bags if you can and try not to worry about the colour of the dildos. Keep an eye on what is going on in the world and hope that things slowly get better. We are now building for the end of the bear which might be a ways down the road, but it will end.\n",

            "\n",
            "The fed always compares year over year numbers when discussing inflation and inflation truly hit, noticeable in real life, during the early to mid part of 2022. For me anyway. That means prices just holding will be deflationary with the way policymakers analyze things. The money supply created didn’t just disappear either, it is still out there ready for investment. \n",
            "\n",
            "If nothing else, sustained inflation and higher prices will undoubtedly cause a recession in the us and they will have to go back to easy money and print tons to bail out whatever big business can’t handle it. The American consumer is tapped out, especially after the holidays. Look at savings and credit card debt stats. If bailouts happen, the rest of the world will print currency too. \n",
            "\n",
            "Also, the longer we sit in this low range, the more confidence investors have of a floor. I don’t really understand why the halving is so widely believed in but it does seem to me like it is going to line up for another bull season.\n",
            "People are worried about a global recession but remember that no recession in history has ever been predicted. They always came in response to some surprise event. Remember that the media likes to write about impending doom because it generates them clicks and ad revenue, that the fed constructs a negative narrative to further their policy goals and that influentials like Jeff Bezos are pushing the same narrative because they want to keep the economy balanced after all that money that was created for COVID stimulus checks. They are telling everybody to sell but meanwhile are loading up their bags. Look at Elon musk buying twitter for 44 billion while he’s predicting a recession and telling people to play it safe. \n",
            "\n",
            "I believe we are likely due for a mild recession with a soft landing because the US economy is proving resilient. Which means that a positive market narrative will start happening somewhere in Q2.\n",

            "New year - new perspectives and possibillities to accumulate a little more crypto. In few years I'm expecting another bull run, so need to be ready! (own observeation that crypto operates in cycles, somewhat like that)\n",

            "We're in a new year so we have some good things to look forward to. First the Chinese new years at the end of January where 1 billion people might invest. February the wall street bonuses will be paid out. They will be lower this year but some might flow towards crypto.\n",
