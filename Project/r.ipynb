The S&P 500 is around the February 2020 high adjusted for inflation. Crab or drop a bit more to the end of February and we'll have an inflation adjusted 3 year flat period. Rates are approaching 5% and unemployment has remained under 4%. Large lay-offs make headlines but labor markets making new hires don't. I'm positive 2023 will be a flat to minor red year at least for traditional markets. Minor green would be cool. Labor markets, I'm betting unemployment remains under 4.5% which is still low unemployment. To me this sets up 2023 to be a year to continue to improve corporate balance sheets, DCA into crypto and speculative growth companies\n",
