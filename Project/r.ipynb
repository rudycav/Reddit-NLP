When I got into crypto I had read to look at a coins holders and if a huge percentage was held by just few wallets that was a bad thing because those wallets have hyper influenceover the price. If I remember right, only around 30% of Litecoin is held by the top 100 wallets, I haven't checked lately so not sure of the exact current percentage. Anyway, that fact was what got me looking into Litecoin, add to it the limited supply, ease and cost of use, Litecoin is now my largest investment, which isn't large by any means.

The most popular posts used to be about zero fees RaiBlocks and how fast it was. Then progressively Ethereum rocketed forward and other coins became cheaper and faster than Litecoin.

If another 11 years passes and there are numerous chains with 11 years straight of uptime and Litecoin has 22 years, does it really matter that Litecoin has done it for years more than another chain? Both have proven themselves to have highly consistent availability. And if those other coins have smart contracts and other popular tokens built on top of them, how does Litecoin compete when it potentially isn't as fast or cheap as the newer blockchain.

The more coins that are “pegged in” the MWeb blocks the more private as it functions as both a mixer and to mask values. MWeb txns prevent people from seeing how much is in your wallet but all coins are still verifiable on the blockchain. It adds another layer of complexity to viewing txns and makes it fungible\n",
