I read the postmortem and that's the kind of shit that scares me the most.  AllianceBlock didn't get hacked or anything.  110 million of their 1 billion supply was drained (and sold) on the Bonq protocol (whatever the fuck that is) causing a massive collapse of the token value.  My first question is why is 10% of the total supply on some obscure protocol?  But even worse is that AllianceBlock is now minting a new token (out of panic imho).  

What a disaster.  Hard to see them rebounding from this, but it is possible I suppose.  I guess the lesson is if you're serious about your project don't lend 10% of your supply to some no-name defi protcol.  Idk, maybe AllianceBlock is sketchier than I give them credit for.",6

Both parties agree to the trade which then triggers the smart contracts and only once both accept.

Basically you'd drag your items or currency into the trade slot and then it will allow you to select a box where it ticks off - which will then lock your trading box so nothing can move in and/or out, with a 10-second timer going down to give you chance to look over and make sure both sides of the trade is what both parties were looking for, after that 10 seconds the accept or trade button goes green and both parties are then able to accept, trigger the smart contract and complete the trade. 

There can also be a chat box added to keep communication there for both parties but with privacy still in place having no access of knowing who you are talking to.",6

They always have to dump which never looks good from an optics standpoint. I remember a while back Juno holders were upset a lead dev was selling but they have bills to pay so what else can they do? Transparency is important in these arrangements but even when it's all out in the open it can make it look like the devs don't believe in the project.

I think we continue up with crypto, with S&P 500 and Bitcoin breaking and holding critical levels, tech stocks recovering, bull crosses all over the board, key resistance getting broken, things are looking good.

You could easily spend $30USD+ on a meal.

But everything in Switzerland is expensive, and that is also considered when it comes to a lot of the wages that people earn in the country.

It also highlights why many live outside Switzerland in border towns and then cross over for work each day.",0

That is indeed the beauty of crypto. Switching currencies sucks, you always lose money on it and have some left when you leave.

Even with FIAT still playing an active role, one can also just very easily convert some FIAT to Bitcoin. Barely costs anything. There's even the option here to pay with Bitcoin or Tether, and Tether is basically ""electronic FIAT"" anyways.",1

Don’t all of those options just make it easier to:
1. Search and sort new releases for sale before they sell out.
2. View and sort the collections which have been sold in the past, for example if you want to see which avatars were included in Gen 1 and their rarities.

A secondary marketplace would be great, but all of this is functionality required to make the current store (for selling new avatars) easier, and doesn’t necessarily indicate that there is a marketplace for the secondary market coming.

There are currently multiple sold out avatars showing in there and they are a mess to view.

To me, it looks like we are just doing some organizing to make the existing store neater.",1

These have later become publicly traded without any governmental pre-approval of disclosures."".

Charlie seems a little confuzzled, cryptos aren't issued like stocks or bonds by a company.  This is probably a knowledge gap at his age he just isn't going to be able to bridge.

Of course some cryptos have been issued by US companies, or companies that skirt where they operate from, like USDT, USDC, BNB etc.

But other cryptos in the top ten weren't issued by a company in the US and/or were issued in a regulatory compliant way Bitcoin, Cardano etc.

Charlie also seems to struggle with the idea that cryptos don't produce anything, but in this way I think he is being disingenuous.  I'm sure he can appreciate a painting or music has value and can be valued beyond its basic component parts.  Crypto has unique features that makes it valuable, and generates value.",1

The only reason they would include a giant transaction with extra data is because 1) there aren't enough transactions to fill up the block or 2) the fee attached to that transaction was large enough that it was worth more to the miner than the larger number of smaller transactions that could fit in that space.

In the second case, it is just the free market, you would end up having to pay the same amount (or more) for your large transaction as the small transactions it would replace.

The majority of that ($3.1 billion) was taken by finding vulnerabilities in bridge services (used to connect different blockchains) that form part of the decentralized finance infrastructure cryptocurrency relies upon.

I still made profits, but mostly on coins already high in market cap. I realized this took too much time, wasn't worth it and stopped doing it. 

Nowadays my criteria is very simple, BTC, ETH and other than that I only invest in Blockchain platforms in the top 20, (excluding stable coins). Any token is automatically ruled out as it requires the platform to be successful. I usually just buy enough for staking or a certain dollar amount. If it ever drops out the top 25 I sell. Yet there are still exceptions as I will never touch BNB or Tron. It's just a gut feeling for some projects.

Very briefly:

Ethos.  No central authority in any dimension, decentralised in every aspect, or a solid plan to reach such a state.  Permission-less and trust-less means you need no-ones permission to use, and you need to trust no-one to use.  No leader who actually wants to be a leader.

Technology.  Learn how blockchains actually work, learn UTxO, Account, Local/Global State, hashing, Merkel trees, Proof of Work/Stake, consensus algorithms, reward mechanisms, asymmetric key encryption, peer2peer networking, data propagation.

Economics.  Inflation/Disinflation/Deflation, money supply, emission rates/halvings, transaction fees, rewards, burns, market cap.

With a good understanding of these basics you should be able to sort absolute crap from viable.  After that follow your gut, if it feels too good to be true, it probably is.

 The way Ripple sells XRP according to GAAP contradicts the SECs claims in Ripple vs SEC.

2023-02-02 14:07:44,Celsius was cheating investors 'from the start' claims audit,EpicHasAIDS,j6y8swt,"No actually.

Not at all.

Let me explain something. I personally looked at Celsius and concluded they were shit before they failed. It took me 20 minutes of research. It was clear there was too much risk. The numbers didn't make sense given interest rates and I couldn't understand how they made money. Not to mention the fact they were paying more than the riskiest bonds in the fucking world. See, **I can read and I can count. I also know if risky companies are paying 9-10% for their bonds, someone who pays 14% is even riskier. That isn't foresight.**

Let me also try to explain this to you slowly. Several US states banned Celsius. That isn't hind sight. We all fucking read that. That should have given the literal morons. The idots. The dunces. Who thought their money was safe at Celsius the alarm to leave. That isn't foresight.

Here's some advice the crypto community is just literally too fucking dumb to take.

If actual US states ban a company you do financial business with you should probably leave.

So to your point. I knew Celsius was a pile of risk before it failed. Anyone who can read, count and think knew it. Now here's another important point, it was clear they were risky. It wasn't clear they were going to fail. People who put their safe money in a risky proposition are dumb. That isn't foresight.

For the hundredth fucking time. **It doesn't take hindsight to realize when savings accounts pay zero and someone wants to pay you 14% there is risk**. It takes having a brain. Not hindsight.

A first year finance student learns that if someone pays you above the risk free rate, there is risk. If someone pays you 10+% above the risk free rate there is a lot of risk. Its alarmingly easy to understand, which is why they teach it in intro finance.",0

Those are directly competing against each other for your dollars; if they're not at similar rates you need to think long and hard about why not.

Again, I don't care if it's from staking or lending, you need to explain where the yield is actually coming from under the hood, and when you dig into it you're not going to like what you find. Who is this mystical person that is giving you the 15% and why are they giving you 15% to use this asset? Where is the money coming into the system that is allowing them to pay you 15% and still expect a profit themselves? Because if it's just other people buying more tokens, then that's a textbook Ponzi scheme.

>Worst that can happen is the price falls but I own the keys

The price will fall off a cliff once people realize the supply inflating at that rate cannot coexist with the price holding or rising without a continuous inflow of money into the system. I'm glad you're fine with having the keys to a vault full of Beanie Babies, but good luck trying to sell those Beanie Babies down the road.",0

2023-02-02 13:16:14,Celsius was cheating investors 'from the start' claims audit,book_of_armaments,j6y0hzu,"Yeah it's written into the code, sure, that's not the point. I fully expect that you will get all the tokens to which you are entitled. The problem is that you will not then be able to turn that number of tokens into the number of dollars or Big Macs or houses that you are expecting to.

They are giving 15% of these tokens to anyone who wants them for free just for hanging on to them. That means the supply is inflating by 15% or people are giving away their own tokens at a rate high enough to support it, or some combination of the two.

If it's inflating at 15%, why would you expect each token to then hold its value? There are now the same number of these tokens chasing the same number of actual goods and services. People selling things and accepting your token as payment should expect 15% more tokens in the future to compensate for this.

If it's people giving you tokens, why would they be willing to give away their tokens now rather than earning 15% themselves unless they can in that time get better returns than 15%?

These huge staking rewards aren't some loophole in economics that nobody had ever considered before; they are just classic Ponzi schemes with so many layers of obfuscation that they're hoping you'll get lost in the details and not look at the big picture long enough to realize that the whole thing is a scam.",0

It's not a Ponzi scheme unless you think that oranges are a Ponzi scheme lol. THEY CAN ALWAYS GROW MORE ORANGES!!! WHY ARE PEOPLE BUYING ORANGES!!!

Doesn't negate the original point that Celsius wasn't offering outrageous percentages. They were offering reasonable returns. People just got caught up in a centralized scam

There is no material difference between what Celsius did and what your coin is doing. Celsius just cut out all of the bullshit steps in the middle and cut straight to taking the money. In both cases, the founders and the people who got out early will have wound up positive, and the rest of the people will wind up with essentially nothing.

No, 14% will never be a reasonable low-risk return unless inflation is well above that, which was not the case for Celsius.

Anyway, I have nothing against arrogant idiots such as yourself losing money on obvious frauds, as you seem intent to do. I just hate when they go ""nobody could have seen it coming"". Lots of people see it coming. I see it coming for your shit scheme and I'm telling you so right now.

They even got a grant from Binance BUIDL.

But with non profits being politically vulnerable as they are already set up to be unable to compete very well with for profit institutions through regulation.

I don’t see how any company that is aware of both the landscape and how they track within it would become outdated. Will it be a top ten coin? No. But that’s not their goal or role.

Mexc: No kyc, but less liquidity and less trustful.

The Ordinals Theory itself is actually very elegant for making on-chain inscriptions (originally talked about in 2012) and quite an innovation but in terms of impact, it's a big nothingburger. Not a single website has knowledgeably covered it. The guy who wrote the medium post last week got literally everything wrong.

Let's get one thing straight. You have ALWAYS been able to upload arbitrary data to bitcoin!

There's actually a LOT of arbitrary data outside of OP\_RETURN. You could always do this using multisigs with arbitrary data for all but N-1 keys. There are in fact documents, texts and other arbitrary data that have been uploaded including the entire whitepaper as a document in 2013.

The ordinals inscriptions are in input script witness. This is not part of UTXO set, it won't affect IBD much as by default scripts are not validated below the [assumevalid block](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/chainparams.cpp#L95) and it's entirely prunable once validated. There's no issues with full blocks, block usage is already 80-85% anyway. You're also limited by [this](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3c098a8aa0780009c11b66b1a5d488a928629ebf/src/policy/policy.h#L24) weight limit.

The good thing (maybe) is you can permanently inscribe valuable digital artefacts (doesn't need to be dumb jpegs) ""cheaper"" than you used to be able to do, but NOT cheap. It's still expensive to do because the inscriptions will have only 1/4 priority of economic transactions. Unless you pay almost 4 times the fee rate of regular transactions ($100 at 1 sat/vb) you will have lower priority. This is also frankly in my opinion one of the least interesting things you could actually do with unbounded witness limit. 998-999 multisig scripts for similar fee as single sig, commitments to merkle tree of one-time use seals with witness and state held off chain is most space efficient thing you can do with Taproot. I don't think we have even imagined some incredibly efficient things that could be done.

These on-chain inscriptions are also NOT NFTs. NFTs are just random hashes for a link to image on some hosted server. Nothing with [this](https://twitter.com/BitPaine/status/1615764109638914049) is on chain! This kind of hash commitment to images hosted off chain actually first came from bitcoin counterparty protocol in 2014 with [Rare Pepes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Pepe).

Tl;dr This kind of use will not be frequent as it will be priced out, maybe reserved for censorship resistant, inexpungible permanent incriptions of messaging or other valuable artefacts, something Julian Assange has apparently already [used](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/znqa8l/new_finding_an_encrypted_7zip_file_possibly/) the bitcoin blockchain for. It's still expensive, inscriptions will have 1/4 priority compared to economic transactions and there are so much more cool stuff to do with Taproot than stuffing arbitrary data in script witness.",11

There's plenty of arbitrary data (unsavoury data) on the bitcoin blockchain dating back to 2010. You could always upload any arbitrary data if you want to pay for it, just like you could upload anything to the internet.

Your node is not downloading and showing you an image. If you want to create a web page to show such images, that's up to you. You suffer the consequences. It would just be another porno site.

So many here are confused about the trade-offs chosen by Bitcoin.... Efficiency is NOT a primary objective of PoW, as its real competition is the Federal Reserve & Central Banks, which take DAYS to settle transactions.  The primary objectives of BTC are trust minimization, security, & decentralization... and ANY coin that has these primary attributes will have to scale with external layers.  I'd like if someone can prove me wrong, but any suggestions you might be thinking of are likely permissioned coins or otherwise place trust in 3rd parties.

PoS is not money, because it's not secure, it's not censorship-resistant, it's not decentralized (at least in the case of Ethereum), and also in the case of Ethereum it has arbitrary & ever-changing rates of inflation / deflation, ready to be changed.  PoS can be useful for many things, just not money.

[And just to beat inevitable replies... no, Bitcoin's mining pools are themselves decentralized, thanks to Stratum v2... meaning that a 51% attack will NEVER happen.  The miners and pool operators actually own their machines and are literally invested in the success of the network, unlike Ethereum nodes which are actually owned by centralized servers that are NOT invested in the success of the network. They could be bribed to manipulate blocks, or just do it on their own while simultaneously shorting Eth and make a killing on its demise.]",2

I'm completely aware of the percentage of TOR nodes, but if countries force all ""local"" nodes behind TOR, I don't think that's really a good thing.  The next evolution would be to label those hosting TOR nodes as part of a criminal network.  I don't doubt that governments will do their best to rewrite the laws on privacy, in order to stop child pornography and money laundering!  All simply avoidable by Bitcoin continuing to be the best TRANSPARENT *monetary* network (which is hard to do when it's [forced to be] hidden in an anonymous fashion)

The fact that a node doesn't ""show"" an image isn't a flawless defense in court.  Otherwise, any perv that has his house raided could simply say that there's no evidence that he's ever SEEN any photo.  Maybe he was just collecting the files and amazing their metadata in order to locate the REAL pervs!?  Or what if the pervs have a collection of photos that aren't in jpg format, but just text files with binary data?!  Is that a better defense?  Doubtful.

If I ran a node, I would prefer to host the full node if at all possible.  There's really no reason not to, so long as you have the storage space, which Bitcoin makes incredibly easy to do, due to its intentionally limited design.  Sure, this data set  isn't ""affecting"" the instruction set of the money... but it could possibly hinder decentralization itself in more ways than one, while making transactions more expensive or at least slower than necessary (which isn't a real problem for the foreseeable future, but who knows where the future really leads?).  The fact that people are not just obsessed with NFTs of images, but also obsessed with spreading NFTs to the settlement layer of a monetary network [where the community didn't want NFTs] is just... well... dumb and sad that it has opened up a can of worms that should've never been opened in the first place.

Maybe I wasn't clear. You can prune witness data after validating and run a proper full node. When you do IBD, by default assumevalid=1. This doesn't mean you're not independently validating every single block. You still validate everything else. The only part of transaction you don't validate below the assumevalid block is input scripts. You're free to set assumevalid=0 and validate scripts too but there's really no security tradeoff because the assumevalid block is thousands of blocks deep and you're sourcing blocks from several nodes, not a single node. Witness discount exists because witness data is the least resource consuming part of a transaction for nodes.

>The fact that people are not just obsessed with NFTs of images, but also obsessed with spreading NFTs to the settlement layer of a monetary network

These are not NFTs as in a hash commitment to random URL on a server somewhere. Those kind of NFTs actually started on bitcoin too as I said. But this is not that and there's no reason why people should be using ordinals to do jpegs. I am not defending ordinals theory. I just don't think it's that big a deal. If nodes come to a consensus that these should be filtered then so be it. I don't think people should be doing jpegs with ordinals theory but my node is undecided whether it should be filtered.",0

According to this indicator a beak above our recent high on $25k, would clear the way for BTC to fast-track towards $27k. Maybe we will even be able to see that soon of the FED meeting goes well if not we probably have a good foundation below us were BTC would catch support easily.

Maybe I'm just not technical enough to understand, but I don't see how a break above 25k could clear the way to 27k. Doesn't it have the same likelihood of breaking down than breaking to the upside?",1

I understand that exchanges aren't risk free, just like I understand banks are not risk free. There have been people burned by banks before. Serious, big, publicly traded Exchanges provide one thing that crypto desperately needs - a way to mass adoption.

You didn't need to keep your money in the bank, in the age of fiat. But most people did, because they trust the bank more to keep it safe than the underside of their bed. It's the same idea. You can keep your wallet, but MANY people will not want that responsibility. Most people will make mistakes, will lose things, will be scammed. They want the bank.

I think the opposite, which we currently have, is the unhealthy thing.  Stuff like Binance controlling 92% of BTC spot trading volume(https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/04/binance-controlled-92-of-bitcoin-spot-trading-volume-at-end-of-2022-arcane-research/) and things like that.

Bitcoin, and its public ledger's transparency in particular, are designed to address this.  Paradoxically even if you physically stole someone's crypto or other digital assets, the charge would likely be what is often called ""hacking"" or more specifically ""Unauthorized computer access"" or ""Unauthorized  network access"".  Even if you legally learned someone's password because they told you it or they left it out to be seen, the moment you access the login system, you have committed the crime of ""hacking"" or ""unauthorized network access"".  Stealing a password or stealing a USB drive with someone's password on it could also be unauthorized access even if they never accessed the system.  If I use a mySQL exploit and figure out your password or user id, it doesnt matter that I didnt use them to login, it is the fact I stole your credentials that makes me guilty of ""unauthorized access to a computer/network"".",1
